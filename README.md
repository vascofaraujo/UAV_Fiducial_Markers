OpenCV: Python C++ Module for Image Processing (Code Sample / Boilerplate / Getting Started / Hello World)
==========================================================================================================

This repository contains a code sample for processing an OpenCV image from Python 3 in C++. For the sake of simplicity, the image transformation is a mirror operation.
It involves creating a Python `hello_world` module that contains the C++ code, and converting the image from a NumPy array to a `Mat` object and back.

To build and run (tested on macOS High Sierra):

    python3 setup.py install && python3 cam.py
